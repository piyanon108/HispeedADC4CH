There is a large setup violation of -3.694 ns between design_1_i/LTC2324_sample_0/inst/ad7606_sample_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/slv_reg1_reg[25]_replica/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and design_1_i/LTC2324_sample_0/inst/ad7606_sample_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/sample_inst/sample_len_d0_reg[25]/D (clocked by mmcm_clk_0_s). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on CLK_IN_D_0_clk_n[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on CLK_IN_D_0_clk_p[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
